      <h1>London</h1>
      <p>Don't know much about sketching, but I love my scribbles and believe me,
        painting, sketching etc can be really therapeutic and helps to fight
        stress and don't just take take my word for it, try yourself.One tip,
        no matter how bad it looks in the start just keep going on,
           there are many perpectives to judge an art thats why no painting can
            be bad even a blank canvas and you know what sometimes it brings out
             your childhood impressions of the world and you might get
             lost in nostalgia.</p>

      <p>Who knows that there might be a great artist suppressed within you
        because of those wrong decisions you took back then, and its never too
        late to find that out. I am a staunch believer of the concept that  Art
         shapes the future  as it inspires science &amp; theory to look around
         for a different perspective, differentiates you from a machine or
         artificial conscience, sometimes keeps you loaded with motivation
         to function beyond your expectations, might even help you find your
         passsion in life. Oh I moved so much away from the topic, here
         check out the article below.</p>
      <p>Moreover sketching, drawing and stuffs like that are more pragmatic
        than we think, we need a lot of creative &amp; design workforce to help
        fuel this digital art revolution going on like in designing VR world,
        interactive books novels magazines, games and so much more in various
        entertainment sectors. There are so many tools available that you wont
        need to know any technical details, just start your pure designing</p>
